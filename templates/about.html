    <h1>what's boa?</h1>
    <br>
    <p><b>boa</b> is a web-based automated reverse engineering platform that helps extrapolate original and readable Python source from a compiled and packed executables. It undergoes the following when an executable sample is processed through its pipeline:</p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Executable Unpacking</b> - parse out resources from Py2Exe and PyInstaller binaries.</li>
        <li><b>Bytecode Decompilation/Patching</b> - decompile and patch (if necessary) Python source from unpacked bytecode.</li>
        <li><b>Static Analysis</b> - scan relevant source files for detrimental security issues.</li>
        <li><b>Report Generation</b> - generate a user-friendly report on executable.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>At the current moment, <b>boa's</b> functionality is still being implemented. PE executables are currently only supported for unpacking and decompilation, and there is still very limited support for virtualization-based deobfucation.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>what can I use it to reverse?</h1>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>closed black-box applications</li>
        <li>malware samples</li>
        <li>ctf and wargame challenges</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h1>how much does it cost?</h1>
    <br>
    <p><b>boa</b> is offered as open-sourced freeware. However, a paid version with much more functionality is being implemented formore professional reverse engineering. See <a href="{{ url_for("pricing") }}">pricing</a> for more information.
